# EvolutionaryAlgorithms
A traveller has to pass in every city of Qatar in the most short distance. 

The main goal of this evolutionary algorithm is to find the most short path between cities in Qatar.

The path starts in a given city, passes in every city of Qatar and ends up in another.

The Indiv class represents the individuals whose genes correspond to a given path. Their fitnesses are calculated by the total travelled distance.

The Popul class represents the population which is composed by individuals.

The EvolAlgorithm represents the evolutionary algorithm.
